# DoConnect

This is a Cogent Infotech capstone project for Java full stack developer batch 65
(Angular front end and service layer, Java back end Rest API, and MySQL relational database) 
and was independantly implemented by [Joshua Gardner](https://jgcoding2020.github.io/My-Portfolio/), Juan David and Jong Kim.

DoConnect is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed as a forum where users can share 
their answers to questions posted by other users. The platform ensures that the content posted is 
monitored and approved by administrators before being visible to all users. Additionally, the application 
incorporates direct messaging functionality, enabling users to engage in private conversations with each other. 
Once the application was developed and tested locally, it was deployed on the web using Amazon Web Services 
infrastructure, including the following components: AWS S3, AWS EC2, AWS RDS.
